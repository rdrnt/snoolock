#Snoolock
Adds a page to your lockscreen via LockPages, where you can view reddit post from your desired subreddit.

I uploaded this for people to learn from, but provide credit where it's due (please) if you base your work off of it. And don't repackage the code and call it your own, that's not cool.

Yes, this code sucks. I originally created it for myself, and didn't really care about formatting or optimizing (It runs fine, though). Feel free to contribute if it bothers you.

I would like to thank David Ashman for creating LockPages, without this, Snoolock wouldn't be possible, [give him a follow on twitter](https://twitter.com/davidbashman)

 Making your own LockPage is very simple, follow the instructions on [LockPages on Github](https://github.com/djkira/LockPages-theos)

#Things to fix/add:
- Read preferences from memory, not disk
- Tidy and re-write some parts of code (Yes, they are very sloppy).
